""This is my code to correctly figure out the expected cost of a package. how to use this code is by putting in 3 floats and 2 integers. The three floats are height, length, and thickness. The two integers are zip codes. for example: 4, 4, .009, 02893, 08516
after you put in your 5 numbers separated by commas, the code should figure out the price of the package.""
